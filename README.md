## About Me

Hola! I am Roberto, a tech enthusiast who loves coding, teaching, finding software vulnerabilities, and continuous learning.

### Full-Time Software Developer

As a software developer, I enjoy discovering new technologies and methodologies while crafting elegant solutions for real-world problems. Writing clean code is my passion and an opportunity to explore and innovate.

### Part-Time Teacher

Teaching is my other calling profession. It's my way of sharing my passion for learning. As a part-time teacher, I aim to inspire curiosity and a love for technology in my students. I take pride in sharing knowledge and empowering the next generation of developers. I am committed to demystifying complex concepts and fostering a love for good development practices.

### Part-Time Bug Bounty Hunter

When I'm not coding or teaching, I spend my free time exploring the complex world of cybersecurity as a part-time bug bounty hunter. I am deeply curious about how systems work and enjoy discovering security vulnerabilities. Collaborating with organizations to enhance their digital defenses is a rewarding experience that motivates me to continue my work.
